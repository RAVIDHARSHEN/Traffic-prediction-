Traffic Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting traffic patterns using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical traffic data, the model aims to forecast future traffic conditions, aiding in better traffic management and planning.

Features
Historical traffic data analysis
Machine learning model for traffic prediction
Visualization of predicted traffic patterns
Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing historical traffic data, including factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and holidays. The dataset in provided or download from kaggle .
